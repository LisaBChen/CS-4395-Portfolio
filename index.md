## Welcome to Lisa's Class Portfolio

At the point of time of the creation of this page, I am a university student with a major in Computer Science. Over the years, I have gained experience in a wide variety of fields ranging from Business to S.T.E.M. In my free time, I enjoy researching and pursuing the topics that interest me. 

## Portfolio Objective

This portfolio highlights work done for the [Introduction to Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/kjmazidi/NLP/blob/gh-pages/index.md) class at UTD with Professor Karen Mazidi. 

The portfolio should have the following components: 
- Optional: (from the outdated instructions) Modifiy the index.md and README.md file to reflect the basic structure of the course
- index.md and README.md (aka main page) should have links for every assignment, instructions, & material that is added to the repository
- Optional: (from the outdated instructions) Add onto the README.md a nararative of what each assignment does (Terms highlighted in *bold*) 
- Use underscores for file names with spaces
- Uploaded to both elearning and Github.

## Portfolio Contents

1. [Overview of NLP Instructions Document](https://github.com/LisaBChen/CS_4395_Portfolio/blob/main/4395_port_hw1.pdf) -- a discussion of historical and current approaches to NLP, along with my personal interest in NLP [(Assignment Document)](https://github.com/LisaBChen/CS_4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Overview_of_NLP.pdf)
    - Github Portfolio Setup [Instructions Document](https://github.com/LisaBChen/CS_4395_Portfolio/blob/main/4395_github_req.pdf): Create a GitHub Portfolio for Class Work 
2. Python Basics -- [Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python](https://github.com/LisaBChen/CS_4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio_Component_1.pdf) -- Read in the employee file that has been made in an obsolete system, and process the text to be more standardized, where an object is created for each person, with any needed corrections applied, and display the person's information. To run this prorgram you need the lastest edition of pycharm, prefereably the community edition, as well as the latest update (latest as of the date that this is written) of python, and use the given run functionalities of python to run the program. In addition, you will need to specify the relative path ‘data/data.csv’ in a sysarg and have all of the files in the correct folders/locations. The weakness of using python for text processing is that it can be slower than when compared to other compiled languages including it's execution speed. In addition, due to certain restrictions in how it was designed because of it being dynamically typed, more errors can pop and further testing is required. However on the other hand, the strength of python is that it has built in functions that that assist in text processing such as with it's string objects. In addition to this, python has additions added to it's standard library that deals with most of the common tasks of text processing. What I learned in this homework includes how to create a python pickle. In addition, I learned how to code a python program that uses sysarg. What was a review for included writing a class in python, and coding regular expressions alongside file I/O. [(Assignment Document)]()
