## Chapter 2: Python Basics
- [**Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python**](https://github.com/LisaBChen/CS_4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Portfolio_Component_1.pdf) -- Read in the employee file that has been made in an obsolete system, and process the text to be more standardized, where an object is created for each person, with any needed corrections applied, and display the person's information. To run this prorgram you need the lastest edition of pycharm, prefereably the community edition, as well as the latest update (latest as of the date that this is written) of python, and use the given run functionalities of python to run the program. In addition, you will need to specify the relative path ‘data/data.csv’ in a sysarg and have all of the files in the correct folders/locations alongside having the right parameter in your pycharm configuration. The weakness of using python for text processing is that it can be slower than when compared to other compiled languages including it's execution speed. In addition, due to certain restrictions in how it was designed because of it being dynamically typed, more errors can pop and further testing is required. However on the other hand, the strength of python is that it has built in functions that that assist in text processing such as with it's string objects. In addition to this, python has additions added to it's standard library that deals with most of the common tasks of text processing. What I learned in this homework includes how to create a python pickle. In addition, I learned how to code a python program that uses sysarg. What was a review for included writing a class in python, and coding regular expressions alongside file I/O.
